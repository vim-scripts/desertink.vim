This is a version of the default desert colorscheme with a darker background and more colorful foreground colors.

It also adds highlighting for folds, diffs, line numbers, signcolumn, completion menus, and cursor line/column.

The colors are automatically converted for 88/256 color terminals, adapted from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1243
